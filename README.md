# üëÄ Why I Choose:
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) <br>
React‚Äôs component-based structure allows for modular, reusable, and maintainable code. This makes it easier to manage and scale large applications, which can enhance productivity and reduce development time. <br>
Also React is highly flexible and can be integrated with various libraries and frameworks. This makes it adaptable for different types of projects and compatible with existing technologies.

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime. This can significantly reduce the number of bugs and improve code reliability. <br>
By enforcing type constraints, TypeScript helps ensure that functions and variables are used correctly. This leads to cleaner, more predictable code and makes the codebase easier to maintain and refactor.

![Chakra](https://img.shields.io/badge/chakra-%234ED1C5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=chakraui&logoColor=white) <br>
Chakra UI provides a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to implement and customize UI components. This can significantly speed up the development process, especially for teams and individual developers looking to quickly build responsive and accessible UIs. <br>
Chakra UI offer a comprehensive set of pre-designed components that follow modern design principles. These components are customizable and come with built-in accessibility features, reducing the need to design and code components from scratch.

![React Router](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=for-the-badge&logo=react-router&logoColor=white) <br>
React Router integrates seamlessly with React, allowing me to manage routing within the React ecosystem without needing to worry about compatibility issues with other libraries or frameworks.

![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/figma-%23F24E1E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma&logoColor=white) <br>
Figma community offers a plethora of shared files, UI kits, and design systems created by other designers. Browsing through these resources can give you ideas, showcase different design approaches, and help you stay current with design trends.

![Netlify](https://img.shields.io/badge/netlify-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=netlify&logoColor=#00C7B7) <br>
Netlify offers a streamlined deployment process with continuous integration. You can connect your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and deploy your site with a single click, automatically triggering deployments on every push to your repository.
